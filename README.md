## The Problem

One of the AMA chapters has requested a weather widget for their site. You have met with the chapter volunteers to
gather all of the requirements:

1. The widget will be a Gutenberg block that allows it to be placed on any page or post.
1. The widget must only show the current temperature of a given zip code.
1. The title of the widget can be set with a block attribute.
1. The widget will look the same whether you are in the post editor or on the frontend of the site.
1. Weather data must be retrieved through the API from https://openweathermap.org/current

## Technical requirements

1. The desired zip code and API key should be saved in a settings page on the WP admin. Please use the [WP Settings API](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/settings/settings-api/).
1. When retrieving the current weather data in the post editor, use a custom REST API route.
1. The weather data should be stored in a transient after retrieval to reduce the number of external API calls.

## Notes

- We have created this boilerplate plugin for you to get you up and running quickly. It is based on
  [@wordpress/create-block](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-create-block/).
  The base block should be available in the post editor after activating this plugin.
- Don't forget good WP security practices (data validation, sanitization, etc.).
- This assignment should take less than 6 hours to complete.
